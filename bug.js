This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The problem is that the `launchImageLibraryAsync` or `launchCameraAsync` functions sometimes return an unexpected result, specifically the `cancelled` property being true even when the user successfully selects an image. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, where you might assume the user cancelled the action when they actually selected a photo.
